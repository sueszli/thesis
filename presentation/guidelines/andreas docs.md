The final presentation (and the midterm if relevant) should be ~15 minutes. It is okay for it to be 16 minutes, but better with 14 minutes. It is important that you ensure the presentation is within this time-frame.
After you have finished there will be a Q&A for around 15 to 30 minutes. This gives people a chance to better understand what you have worked on.

Other people from the group and the professor will attend the presentation. You should therefore expect at least four people (incl. me and Prof. Wattenhofer) in the "audience".

I will always do at least one mock presentation with you before you have to present for the group.
